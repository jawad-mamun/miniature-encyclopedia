# Miniature Encyclopedia

Welcome to a little version of Wikipedia! Here, you can create, view, and edit encylopedia pages. 
All edits/entries in the encyclopedia are done with Markdown Text. [Click here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links) to see some cool features of Markdown text and how to use it!

* **Home Page**: Renders a page displaying a list of all the entries in the encyclopedia. Clicking on an entry will take you to its entry page. 
* **Entry Page**: Renders a page that displays the contents of that encyclopedia entry. If an entry is requested that does not exist, the user should be presented with an error page indicating that their requested page was not found. You can also click on Edit Page to the left to edit the existing page.
* **Search**: Search for a page. If the page exists, you'll be taken to the page. If the page doesn't exist, you'll be presented with a list of pages that have your query as a substring.
* **New Page**: Click here to create a new page. You'll be able toenter a title for the page and, in a textarea, you'll be able to enter the Markdown content for the page.
* **Random Page**: Click here if you're feeling adventurous to be taken to a random encylopedia page!

Here's some examples of what the page looks like:
